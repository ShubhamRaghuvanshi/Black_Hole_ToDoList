+ $\color{red} \text{Read RAMSES code paper and user manual}$
  + Read up about Black holes and LCDM cosmology 
  + Black hole types and formation scenario
  + Matematical details in GR
  + Seeding mechanisms 
+ Set up cluster account on office desktop, laptop and Remote acees
+ Set up code editors and IDE for cluter(VSCode, sshfs) 
+ Run example simualtions (1Dtube) and analyze data
+ Understand details of DM initial conditions relavant for simulation
  + Multi-scale initial conditions for cosmological simulations (O. Hahn, T. Abel)
  + The large-scale orientations of disc galaxies (O. Hahn)
  + The properties of cosmic velocity fields (O. Hahn, T. Abel)
  + Multiscale Gaussian Random Fields and Their Application to Cosmological Simulations (Edmund Bertschinger)
+ Generate Initial conditions (graphic, music)
+ Run DM simulations with MPI
+ Think of interesting aspects of the output and see how it fits the Standard model
