## Modified Version of Cosmological simulation code Gadget2 with polytropic EOS, sink particles and constant external pressure boundaries.

+ The following images show the disk fragmentation in primordial gas clouds for different degrees of rotation.The rotation parameter $\beta$ is the ratio of rotational energy to the gravitational energy of the cloud. While dots in the images are sink(star) particles in the simulations.

## Logarithmically scaled number density

## Temperature
